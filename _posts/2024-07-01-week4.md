My fourth week at the Civic AI Lab was focused on refining and resubmitting IRB documentation. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **IRB Documentation:** Received feedback from the IRB office and spent the week making necessary edits to our documentation.
- **Team Meetings:** Continued participating in regular team meetings to stay updated on ongoing projects.

Looking forward to the upcoming weeks as we finalize the IRB documentation. Stay tuned for updates!
