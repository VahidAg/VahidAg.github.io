As I conclude my first month at the Civic AI Lab, I'm excited to share the progress and educational opportunities I've encountered. Here’s what this week looked like:

### IRB Documentation
I finalized and submitted the necessary IRB documentation drafts to the IRB office for review. This step is crucial in ensuring our project adheres to ethical standards and is compliant with institutional regulations.

### Team Meetings
Continued my participation in regular team meetings, which are vital for syncing with ongoing projects and collaborative efforts within the lab.

### Code Review for Data Analysis
I spent time reviewing and refining our data analysis code. This task is key to ensuring the accuracy of our findings and supports the integrity of our research.

### Literature Reviews
I kept up with literature reviews to better understand the historical and current landscape of Civic AI research. These reviews help integrate our efforts with the broader academic community’s insights.

### DREAM Meeting
Attended the DREAM Meeting alongside other students, mentors, and advisors. This session featured guest speakers discussing PhD programs, providing valuable perspectives and insights into academic progression in AI and related fields.

Reflecting on this month, it's been a journey of significant learning and contribution. I’m eager to see the development of our projects and to dive deeper into the innovative field of Civic AI.

Stay tuned for more updates!
