This week, I finalized the data analysis and focused on polishing the technical report:

- **Justification of Statistical Choices:** Clearly articulated in the report why the Mann-Whitney U Test was chosen over other methods like the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test and t-tests, emphasizing its suitability for non-normal data distributions.
- **Limitations Acknowledgment:** Addressed study limitations, such as the sample size and potential learning curves with the new tool, to provide a balanced perspective.
- **Discussion Enhancement:** Expanded on the implications of the findings, noting that while the quantitative results did not show significant differences, qualitative feedback highlighted the potential benefits of AI tools for freelancers.
- **Feedback Incorporation:** Integrated feedback from Dr. Saiph Savage to improve clarity and coherence throughout the report, ensuring that the methodology and analysis were well-explained.

Committed to delivering a comprehensive and insightful final report!
