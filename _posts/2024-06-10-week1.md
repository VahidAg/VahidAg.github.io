My second week at the Civic AI Lab has been both exciting and educational. I started by conducting a user study to understand how gig workers perform their tasks. Using the office Mind tool, I had participants complete tasks using only the tool's functions and analyzed the generated data to identify areas for improvement in their workflow. This process helped me start learning about human-centered design and the practical aspects of evaluating designs based on how people actually engage with them.

Meeting my advisor and the rest of the team was a great experience. We had our weekly team meeting, where I got to know more about the ongoing projects, and we also took team and profile photos for the lab’s documentation.

I had the opportunity to collaborate with Google Research, learning about and testing two of their tools. I'm organizing and planning sessions to test these tools next week, which I'm really looking forward to.

Additionally, I completed the mandatory certification for conducting human research, ensuring I’m fully prepared for the projects ahead.

I’m excited about the upcoming weeks and can’t wait to contribute more to the team. Stay tuned for updates!
