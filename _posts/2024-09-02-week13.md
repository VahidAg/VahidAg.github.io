During week thirteen, I continued with data analysis and began drafting the results section of my report:

- **Alternative Methods Exploration:** Considered other statistical approaches, such as t-tests on log-transformed data and permutation tests, to ensure robustness of the results. Found that log transformation did not sufficiently normalize the data.
- **Confirmation of Statistical Approach:** Confirmed that the Mann-Whitney U Test remained the most suitable method given the data characteristics.
- **Result Interpretation:** Interpreted the statistical outputs, understanding that despite trends favoring the intervention group, the differences were not statistically significant.
- **Literature Review:** Reviewed related work to understand the relevance of AI assistance for gig workers, which provided context for my findings and highlighted the importance of tools like OfficeMind.

Continuing analysis!
