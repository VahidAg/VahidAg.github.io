During week thirteen, I continued with the analysis and began drafting the results section of my report:

- **Additional Statistical Considerations:** Considered other statistical methods to ensure robustness of the results. Explored the possibility of using t-tests on log-transformed data, but the transformation did not normalize the data sufficiently.
- **Consistency Check:** Confirmed that the Mann-Whitney U Test remained the most appropriate choice given the data distribution.
- **Result Interpretation:** Interpreted the statistical outputs, understanding that while the intervention group showed improvements, the differences were not statistically significant.
- **Report Writing:** Began writing the results section, carefully explaining the analysis process, the rationale behind choosing specific statistical tests, and the interpretation of the findings.

Continuing analysis!
