My fifth week at the Civic AI Lab continued with refining and resubmitting IRB documentation. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **IRB Documentation:** Continued making necessary edits based on feedback from the IRB office.
- **Team Meetings:** Participated in regular team meetings to stay updated on ongoing projects.
- **Team Lunch:** Attended a team lunch at Symphony Sushi for the Lab CSCW Sushi Celebration with my PI and teammates.
- **Meeting with PI:** Met with my PI to discuss my progress and finalize my research project.

Looking forward to finalizing the IRB documentation and starting new projects. Stay tuned for updates!
