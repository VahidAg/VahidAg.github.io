In my twelfth week, I delved deeper into data analysis and began comparing the control and intervention groups. Key activities included:

- **Selection of Statistical Tests:** Evaluated several non-parametric tests, including the Mann-Whitney U Test, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, and permutation tests, to determine which would best suit our data.
- **Justification of Method Choice:** Chose the Mann-Whitney U Test for comparing the groups because it is appropriate for independent samples with non-normal distributions and unequal sample sizes.
- **Data Analysis Execution:** Applied the Mann-Whitney U Test to compare task completion times and SUS scores between the control and intervention groups.
- **Interim Findings:** Noted trends suggesting that the intervention group completed tasks more quickly, but initial results did not show statistically significant differences.

Eager to interpret these findings and understand their implications!
