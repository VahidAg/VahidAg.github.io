In week fourteen, I focused on refining the analysis and enhancing the discussion in my report:

- **In-Depth Analysis:** Analyzed potential reasons for the lack of statistically significant differences, considering factors such as sample size, variability within groups, and the complexity of tasks.
- **Discussion Development:** Enhanced the discussion section by exploring the implications of the results for freelancers and the potential benefits of AI tools like OfficeMind.
- **Methodological Reflection:** Reflected on other analytical approaches that could be employed in future studies, such as increasing the sample size or adjusting the study design to capture more nuanced effects.
- **Related Work Integration:** Incorporated insights from related research on AI integration in gig work platforms to contextualize my findings and emphasize the relevance of AI assistance to gig workers.

 Analysis continues!
