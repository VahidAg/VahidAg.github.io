In my tenth week, I concluded the GPAI interviews and transitioned to data analysis for my other projects. Here's a summary of my tasks:

- **GPAI Interviews:** Completed all remaining interviews for the GPAI project, marking the end of data collection.
- **Data Preparation:** Began organizing and cleaning the collected data in preparation for analysis.
- **Team Meetings:** Participated in weekly GPAI team meetings to discuss the next phase.

Excited to dive into the data and uncover insights!
