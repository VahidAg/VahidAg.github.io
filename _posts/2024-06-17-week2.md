My third week at the Civic AI Lab involved attending team meetings, continuing interviews, and data analysis. Here’s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **Team Meetings:** Participated in regular team meetings to stay updated on ongoing projects.
- **Interviews and Data Analysis:** Continued conducting interviews and analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Certifications:** Completed additional mandatory certifications.
- **Literature Reviews:** Reviewed literature on past and present research in the Civic AI Lab to get a better understanding of the work being done.

I’m excited about the upcoming weeks and can’t wait to contribute more to the team. Stay tuned for updates!
