My sixth week at the Civic AI Lab involved finalizing and submitting IRB documentation and planning for upcoming projects. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **IRB Documentation:** Finalized and submitted the IRB documents, now awaiting feedback.
- **Team Meetings:** Continued participating in regular team meetings to stay updated on ongoing projects.
- **GPAI Collaboration:** Had a meeting with a GPAI collaborator from Poland to discuss designing a study for a Mini GPAI internship, which will be my next project for the summer.

Excited about the new projects and collaborations. Stay tuned for updates!
