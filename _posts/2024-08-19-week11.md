In week eleven, I shifted my focus entirely to data analysis for my final project. With all participant recruitment and data collection completed earlier, this week was dedicated to diving deep into the collected data for the officeMind study. Here's what I worked on:

- **Data Organization:** Began by organizing and cleaning the collected data from the 50 participants, ensuring accuracy and completeness. This included task completion times and System Usability Scale (SUS) scores from both the control and intervention groups.
- **Exploration of Statistical Methods:** Researched various statistical tests suitable for our data characteristics. Considered both parametric and non-parametric tests, weighing their assumptions and applicability to our dataset.
- **Normality Testing:** Performed normality tests, such as the Shapiro-Wilk test, on the SUS scores and task completion times to determine the distribution of the data. The results indicated that the data were not normally distributed.
- **Decision on Analysis Approach:** Based on the normality test results, decided to use non-parametric statistical methods for further analysis, as they do not assume a normal distribution.

Looking forward to applying these methods to extract meaningful insights from the data!
