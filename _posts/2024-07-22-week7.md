My seventh week at the Civic AI Lab involved significant progress on the GPAI project and team engagements. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **IRB Feedback:** Awaited feedback on IRB submissions.
- **Team Meetings:** Continued participation in weekly team meetings to discuss our findings and research improvements.
- **GPAI Interviews:** Started the first interviews for the GPAI project to gather insights.

Looking forward to continuing this momentum in the coming weeks!
