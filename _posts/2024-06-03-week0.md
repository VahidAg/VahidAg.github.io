My first week at the Civic AI Lab at Northeastern University was a great orientation experience. I met virtually with my advisor to learn about the research being conducted in the lab and worked on establishing my schedule and tasks. Here’s a summary of what I accomplished:

- **Orientation and Scheduling:** Learned about the lab’s research focus and established my schedule and tasks for the upcoming weeks.
- **Website Completion:** Completed my GitHub profile webpage and had it reviewed and approved by my advisor before submitting it.
- **Team Integration:** Met my advisor virtually to learn more about our research.
  
I’m excited about the upcoming weeks and can’t wait to dive deeper into the research projects. Stay tuned for updates!
