## About Me

My name is Vahid Agbortoko. I am currently pursuing my MSCS at Northeastern University in Portland, Maine. With a background in Biochemistry, I'm deeply passionate about precision medicine, drug discovery research, and the intersection of automation and computational biology. My studies in computer science are fueled by a desire to explore the connections between technology and medicine, aiming to drive impactful advancements in healthcare.

With over a decade of experience in wet-lab and clinical research, I bring a deep understanding of biological processes to my current work.

I'm also keenly interested in machine learning, AI, and data engineering for their potential to uncover hidden insights and address significant challenges across various domains.

Outside of academics, I enjoy basketball, hiking, drawing, cooking, and music production.

I'm open to collaborations and invite you to contact me via email to explore potential opportunities.
