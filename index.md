## About Me

My name is Vahid Agbortoko. I am currently pursuing my MSCS at Northeastern University in Portland, Maine. With a background in Biochemistry, I'm deeply passionate about precision medicine, drug discovery research, and the intersection of automation and computational biology. My studies in computer science are fueled by a desire to explore the connections between technology and medicine, aiming to drive impactful advancements in healthcare.

With over a decade of experience in wet-lab and clinical research, I bring a deep understanding of biological processes to my current work.

I'm also keenly interested in machine learning, AI, and data engineering for their potential to uncover hidden insights and address significant challenges across various domains.

Outside of academics, I enjoy basketball, hiking, drawing, cooking, and music production.

I'm open to collaborations and invite you to contact me via email to explore potential opportunities.

## About My Project

The project will focus on collaborating with AI specialists to design and implement tools aimed at enhancing worker productivity and job satisfaction. Additionally, it will involve conducting research to understand the specific needs and challenges faced by workers in diverse industries. Prototyping and testing AI solutions we will prioritize ethical considerations and the well-being of workers. As part of this initiative, I will be working with the Global Partnership on AI ([GPAI](https://gpai.ai/)) within their student community.

In terms of educational outreach, the project will aim to organize and lead mini academic events to educate workers about AI fundamentals. It will also involve developing clear and engaging educational materials that demystify AI technologies and their applications in the workplace. Facilitating discussions and workshops that will encourage workers to explore how AI can be used responsibly and beneficially in their daily tasks.
